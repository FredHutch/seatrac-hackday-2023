!Series_summary = Control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection requires generation of T cells that migrate to granulomas, complex immune structures surrounding sites of bacterial replication. Here we compared the gene expression profiles of T cells in pulmonary granulomas, bronchoalveolar lavage and blood of Mtb-infected rhesus macaques to identify granuloma-enriched T cell genes. TNFRSF8/CD30 was among the top genes that was upregulated in both CD4 and CD8 granuloma T cells and independent of bacterial loads. Transcriptomic profiling of lung T cells from Mtb-infected mixed bone marrow chimeric mice showed that CD30 directly promotes CD4 T cell differentiation and effector molecule expression. Moreover, in mice CD30 expression on CD4 T cells is required for survival of Mtb infection. These results show the CD30 co-stimulatory axis is highly upregulated on granuloma T cells and is critical for the generation of protective T cell responses against Mtb infection.

Samples were washed and stained with Fixable viability dye eFluor780 from eBioscience/ThermoFisher Scientific (Massachusetts, USA) for 20 minutes at 4°C and thoroughly washed using 1X PBS with 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Samples were sorted using a BD FACS Aria in a biosafety cabinet inside a BSL3 laboratory. Sorted cell populations were pelleted and stored in Trizol at -80°C until RNA isolation. RNA was isolated using Direct-zol RNA kit from Zymo Research (California, USA) according to the manufacturers protocol.
