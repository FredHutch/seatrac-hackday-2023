!Series_summary = To determine the blood transcriptional response to BCG vaccination administered via different routes in rhesus macaques and identify correlates of vaccine-mediated protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) challenge.
!Series_overall_design = Thirty-six macaques received BCG vaccination through different routes: aerosol (AE, n=7), intradermal (ID, n=7), high-dose intradermal (HD-ID, n=8), combined aerosol and intradermal (AE/ID, n=7), and intravenous (IV, n=7). IV-vaccinated macaques received 5x10^7 CFUs of BCG (high-dose). Macaques were challenged with Mtb six to ten months following BCG vaccination and euthanized 11-15 weeks following challenge or at humane endpoint. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed on whole blood samples collected at baseline and two days, two weeks, and twelve weeks following vaccination.
