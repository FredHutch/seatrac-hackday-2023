!Series_summary = To determine the blood transcriptional response to BCG vaccination administered via different routes in rhesus macaques and identify correlates of vaccine-mediated protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) challenge.
!Series_overall_design = Thirty-six macaques received BCG vaccination through different routes: aerosol (AE, n=7), intradermal (ID, n=7), high-dose intradermal (HD-ID, n=8), combined aerosol and intradermal (AE/ID, n=7), and intravenous (IV, n=7). IV-vaccinated macaques received 5x10^7 CFUs of BCG (high-dose). Macaques were challenged with Mtb six to ten months following BCG vaccination and euthanized 11-15 weeks following challenge or at humane endpoint. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed on whole blood samples collected at baseline and two days, two weeks, and twelve weeks following vaccination.

We removed genes in the globin family, genes that were unannotated, and genes with fewer than 5 reads in over two-thirds of all samples. We applied DESeq2’s variance stabilizing transformation to generate normalized expression values.
