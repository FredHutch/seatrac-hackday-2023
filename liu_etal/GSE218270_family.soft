!Series_summary = To determine the blood transcriptional response to intravenous (IV) BCG vaccination in rhesus macaques and identify correlates of vaccine-mediated protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) challenge.
!Series_overall_design = Thirty-four rhesus macaques of Indian origin were vaccinated with half-log increasing doses of IV BCG (between 3.9x10e4 and 2.5x10e7 CFU) and challenged with Mtb twenty-four weeks later. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed on whole blood samples collected at baseline (four weeks pre-vaccination) and at two days, two weeks, four weeks, and twelve weeks following IV BCG vaccination. All timepoints were prior to Mtb challenge.

!Sample_data_processing = We trimmed reads with Cutadapt and performed quality control checks with FastQC before aligning to the Macaca mulatta genome (mmul_10) using kallisto. We removed genes in the globin family, genes that were unannotated, and genes with fewer than 5 reads in over two-thirds of all samples. We applied DESeq2â€™s variance stabilizing transformation to generate normalized expression values.
